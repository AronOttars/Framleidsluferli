    <h2 style="text-align: center; color:white;background-color:rgb(0,51,102)">CNC milling</h2>

    <p>Our instructor told us that this project could be used as a part of the final project, before that I had a problem
    that needed a solution. So I used the opportunity and used this project as part of the final project and my own project.</p>

    <h3>My contribution to the final project</h3>
    <p>
      As I have the most experience in the group with cnc milling I was in charge of the design and manufacturing of everything that had to be milled.
      A detailed explanation of my contribution can be found <a href="framleidsluferli.html">here</a> by scrolling down to the final project section
    </p>


    <h3>Small night stand with built in charging stations</h3>

    <p>
    The only electrical plugs around my bed are beneath the bed at very hard to reach areas
    or accross the room. My bed sits along side a radiator, but the radiator does not go all the way into the corner leaving
    some space between the wall and the bed. There is a nightstand on the other side of the bed that does not have any electrical plugs.
    Another problem that would be solved by having a small night stand in the space between the wall and the bed is that when watching
    a movie in bed with my girlfriend she could put her drink on the table.
    </p>

    <img style="width:40%;" src="Myndir/CNC/Gat.jpg" alt="Mynd af gati" class="center">

    <p>
    As can be seen in the photo above the space is fairly small. It is around 550x90mm so that has to be taken into account when deciding what to put on the table.
    The features it must have are:
    <ul>
      <li>Storage space for phone, drinks or other small items</li>
      <li>Charging capabilities for phone and computer</li>
      <li>Nice overall look</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    It is important that the table has at lease one electrical plug to charge a computer when watching a movie. I wanted to have wireless charging capabilities
    but with the available space it would not fit and I therefore went with a 3x usb hub from <a href="https://www.ikea.is/products/579641">IKEA</a>. Next I found
    a suitable electrical plug, I wanted everything to sit flush with the top of the table and decided to go with an electrical plug without a cover from
    <a href="https://www.husa.is/netverslun/ljos-raflagnaefni/rofar-tenglar/innfellt-efni-merten/?itemid=6098995">Húsasmiðjan</a> this plug takes up most of
    the horizontal space of the table so it would not be possible to have two side by side, but there could be more than one along the vertical axis. I decided
    to begind designing the table with one electrical plug and then change the design if I felt that another could be added.
    </p>

    <img style="width:60%;" src="Myndir/CNC/HandTeiknad.jpg" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">

    <p>
      Now the next step is to start drawing up the design in Autodesk Inventor. I decided to make the table 500x90 mm as the bed could be pushed up against the
      end of the table, but I wanted to have a little space on either end of the wall and radiator.
    </p>

    <img style="width:40%;" src="Myndir/CNC/BaseDim.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">

    <p>
      I then extruded the sketch to 20mm thickness. The next step is to add a cutout for the 3x usb hub, as the power cord for the hub is fixed I needed to make sure
      that it could be inserted into the table while not being loose during use. I cut out a slot slightly bigger than the given dimentions of the item and then cut
      out a small rectangle on one side underneath so the cable would fit.
    </p>

    <img style="width:30%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/HoleWithSketchPlane.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">
    <img style="width:30%;" src="Myndir/CNC/CutThrough.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">

    <p>
      Now I needed to create a cutout for the electrical plug. I could not find the dimentions online so I went out and bought one socket to make sure that it would
      fit perfectly. I then noted down the crutial dimentions and created a cutout for the head of the socket and the fastening plate.
    </p>

    <img style="width:20%;" src="Myndir/CNC/Bottom.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">

    <p>
      After looking at the design I wanted to have the electrical plug by the edge and the usb hub closer to the center so I changed the design to this idea and I also
      added fillets along the edges.
    </p>

    <img style="width:40%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/RightOrder.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">

    <p>
      Now the design is complete!
    </p>

    <p>
      After talking with Arnar from FabLab about what material I could use for the table he told me tha there was some spare 23mm thick walnut that was used in another
      project that I could use for if I wanted. This is a very good looking wood so I imediately accepted the offer. Now before I can start machine the table on
      the cnc milling machine I need to create a file that the machine can read. As this design has some overhangs it can not be milled out completely with one
      operation, I will need to mill one side first, then flip the part over and mill the bottom side as well.

      To do this I will use the HSM/CAM <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/inventor-hsm-ultimate">add in</a> for Inventor. First the setup folder
      is created and these settings are used for the top of the table:
      <ul>
        <li>Machine: Generic 3 axis</li>
        <li>Operation type: Milling</li>
        <li>Select the x and y axis so that the z axis points upwards, as this part is fairly small it does not matter which axis is the x axis</li>
        <li>Origin: Select box point, and select one of the bottom corners</li>
        <li>For the stock I made sure that there was no added stock on the bottom but added 1mm of stock to the sides and 3mm of stock to the top to match the thickness of the real stock</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <img style="width:50%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/CNCHilla1.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">
    <img style="width:50%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/CNCHilla2.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">

    <p>
      Now the setup is complete, the next step is to define the tool that will be used.
    </p>

    <img style="width:50%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/CNCHilla3.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">

    <p>
      To clear out the holes for the electrical plug and the usb hub, the 3D pocket strategy is used.
    </p>

    <img style="width:50%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/CNCHilla4.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">
    <img style="width:50%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/CNCHilla5.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">
    <img style="width:50%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/CNCHilla6.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">
    <img style="width:50%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/CNCHilla7.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">
    <img style="width:50%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/CNCHilla8.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">

    <p>
      After simulating this strategy this is how the part will look
    </p>

    <img style="width:50%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/CNCHilla9.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">

    <p>
      Now the same is done for the bottom side. The steps are the same as for the top side so I will not show them but after simulating this is the result.
    </p>

    <img style="width:50%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/CNCHilla10.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">

    <p>
      To finish off I need to cut the outer perimeter out of the stock, this was done with the 2D contour strategy using multiple depths to cut all the way through.
    </p>

    <img style="width:50%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/CNCHilla11.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">
    <img style="width:50%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/CNCHilla12.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">

    <p>
      I exported these files as two files, top toolpath and bottom toolpath, this add in features support for the shopbot milling machines that FabLab Reykjavík has
      so exporting is very easy.
    </p>

     <img style="width:30%; margin-bottom: 2%;" src="Myndir/CNC/CNCHilla13.JPG" alt="Hand teiknað borð" class="center">

     <p>
       Now that everything is ready I headed up to FabLab to cut it out. I found the cutter that I had specified in Inventor and put it into the holder.
     </p>

     <p>
       Unfortunately I forgot to take photos of the process of the machine cutting as I was also teaching some of the new members of Team Spark how to use the machine
       safely. I did however take some photos of the outcome. When the part came out the right corners were rounded as the cutter is circular and cannot cut a perfect
       right corner, this was easily fixed with some files. The machine also did not cut out the middle of the cutout for the usb hub, I am not sure why it did not cut
       out the middle but it was okay as I used a chisle to break it off. As the stock I was using was scrap from another project I did not notice some fastening holes in
       the stock that ended up being on the edge of the table and does not look good. It is okay however as the edge is completly hidden by the bed and this will therefore
       not be seen.
     </p>

     <p>
       I tried putting both the electrical plug and usb hub into their sockets and used the file to remove material from the corners until it fit perfectly.
     </p>

       Next I spoke to Arnar and asked if he had any experience with wood finishes, he told me that the person that used this wood in the previous project used teak oil to finish
       the wood and it came out very nice so I did the same. After putting some oil onto some paper towels I coated the entire table in it and it looks extremely nice!
     </p>

     <p>
       I then went to Byko to pick up two angle irons to fasten the table to the wall. The finished project came out so much better than I had hoped for and will come very much in handy.
