    <h3>Vika 1</h3>
    <p>
      For this project I decided to work with Inventor, this is mainly because most big companies use either Inventor or Solidworks
      and I want to use this opportunity to further my skills with those programs. Fusion 360 is more user friendly and easier to work with
      for small projects like this one. Now I just needed an idea for a project, I started by looking through google images and found some good ideas
      but after watching a video about parametric design in Fusion 360
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U2JPfkQpsE">(Fusion360: Automatically sized finger-joints)</a>
      I stumbled upon a video about a laptop stand and liked the idea very much
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7riGolu7BpA">(Designing a Lasercut Laptop Stand with Fusion 360)</a>.
      Now that I had an idea for a project I made a VERY rough sketch outlining the basic parameters that I would need.
    </p>

    <img style="width:50%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/Sketch.jpg" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

    <p>
      Now I opened Inventor and started adding user perameters that I would need to draw the feet of the laptop stand.
    </p>

    <img style="width:50%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/ParametersLeg.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

    <p>
      Usign these parameters I finished drawing the foot and for parameters that were not user defined I defined them
      so that they would be dependant on the user defined parameters.
    </p>

    <img style="width:50%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/FinishedFootParameters.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

    <p>
      After finishing the foot and a basic top plate I created a new assembly and started putting the first parts into the assembly
      but I soon ran into some problems, for starters after importing the user defined parameters the only way to change them was to go
      into the original part and change the parameters there, which is not ideal for a parametric design. Another problem was that
      when editing the top plate the best method for cutting the fingers is using the combine tool, which after a quick google search
      is not available when editing parts in an assembly. <br>

      I started looking around the internet for parametric design using Inventor and found a great video explaining top-down Designing
      techniques using Inventor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI2Vl8vbm00">(Inventor Advanced Assembly Techniques)</a>
      After watching the video I decided that the best method for my project would be to use solid-body modeling, which is essentially
      how Fusion 360 works. <br>
      Now I started a new drawing and started defining all the basic parameters that I would need and would be likely to change depending
      on the size of the laptop. When new parts are needed in the drawing the extrution setting are set to "New Solid" so there will be
      many solid bodies in the single part file.
    </p>

    <img style="width:20%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/NewSolid.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

    <p>
      These are all the parameters that I have needed to define myself while drawign the feet and top plate of the laptop stand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next week I will draw the supports and finalize the design, then go to FabLab to lasercut the laptop stand and assemble
      the final product.
