    <h3>Week 1</h3>
    <p>
      For this project I decided to work with Inventor, this is mainly because most big companies use either Inventor or Solidworks
      and I want to use this opportunity to further my skills with those programs. Fusion 360 is more user friendly and easier to work with
      for small projects like this one. Now I just needed an idea for a project, I started by looking through google images and found some good ideas
      but after watching a video about parametric design in Fusion 360
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U2JPfkQpsE">(Fusion360: Automatically sized finger-joints)</a>
      I stumbled upon a video about a laptop stand and liked the idea very much
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7riGolu7BpA">(Designing a Lasercut Laptop Stand with Fusion 360)</a>.
      Now that I had an idea for a project I made a VERY rough sketch outlining the basic parameters that I would need.
    </p>

    <img style="width:50%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/Sketch.jpg" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

    <p>
      Now I opened Inventor and started adding user perameters that I would need to draw the feet of the laptop stand.
    </p>

    <img style="width:50%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/ParametersLeg.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

    <p>
      Usign these parameters I finished drawing the foot and for parameters that were not user defined I defined them
      so that they would be dependant on the user defined parameters.
    </p>

    <img style="width:50%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/FinishedFootParameters.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

    <p>
      After finishing the foot and a basic top plate I created a new assembly and started putting the first parts into the assembly
      but I soon ran into some problems, for starters after importing the user defined parameters the only way to change them was to go
      into the original part and change the parameters there, which is not ideal for a parametric design. Another problem was that
      when editing the top plate the best method for cutting the fingers is using the combine tool, which after a quick google search
      is not available when editing parts in an assembly. <br>

      I started looking around the internet for parametric design using Inventor and found a great video explaining top-down Designing
      techniques using Inventor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI2Vl8vbm00">(Inventor Advanced Assembly Techniques)</a>
      After watching the video I decided that the best method for my project would be to use solid-body modeling, which is essentially
      how Fusion 360 works. <br>
      Now I started a new drawing and started defining all the basic parameters that I would need and would be likely to change depending
      on the size of the laptop. When new parts are needed in the drawing the extrution setting are set to "New Solid" so there will be
      many solid bodies in the single part file.
    </p>

    <img style="width:20%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/NewSolid.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

    <p>
      These are all the parameters that I have needed to define myself while drawign the feet and top plate of the laptop stand.
    </p>

    <img style="width:50%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/UserParametersStandurByrjun.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

    <p>
      Next week I will draw the supports and finalize the design, then go to FabLab to lasercut the laptop stand and assemble
      the final product.
    </p>

    <h3>Week 2</h3>

    <p>The goal for this week is to finish the CAD drawing that is missing supports between the legs and then prepare the
    files for laser cutting and cut them out at FabLab Reykjavík.
    <br>
    The first thing I did this week was to draw the main support beam between the two feet. After some consideration I decided
    how I wanted to dimention the support, I first started by offsetting a plane from the back of the legs so the support would not be
    all the way at the back of the stand.
   </p>

   <img style="width:30%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/SupportPlane.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">
   <img style="width:50%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/SupportSketchDimProb.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

   <p>This however lead to some problems when changing the base parameters, most notably the width of the support did not change
   with the width between the legs.</p>

   <img style="width:50%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/SupportPartProblems.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

   <p>This was however fixed quite easily with two collinear constraints on either side of the support, I also experimented with the
   other dimentions until I was happy with the way the main support was changing with the rest of the drawing. These were the final dimentions
   that I settled on.</p>

   <img style="width:50%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/MainSupportDim.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

   <p>To make sure that the top plate of the stand would not bend to much in use I also added some top plate supports at the front and
   back of the stand. These were made much the same way as the main support though these are smaller and lie perpendicular to the top plate
   to provide the maximum rigidity.</p>

   <img style="width:50%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/TopPlateSupportSketch.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">
   <img style="width:30%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/TopPlateSupports.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

   <p>I then added one more support for the legs a little bit in front of the main support</p>

   <img style="width:30%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/CrossSupport.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

   <p>To make sure that the laptop stand would not break (and for fun), I did a VERY basic finite element analysis, I did not specify the
   element type or define the mesh, I just assumed Inventor would automatically use elements and a mesh that was good enough, this is therfore
   probably pretty inacurate but does however give a very rough idea of how the laptop stand will handle the load of a laptop and hands. The
   scale of the displacement has also been increased to show how the final product might displace.
  </p>

  <img style="width:50%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/SpennuGreining.png" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

   <p>Now the drawing was complete.</p>

   <img style="width:30%; float:left; margin-left: 20%" src="Myndir/Pressfit/CADRenderFront.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch">
   <img style="width:30%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/CADRenderBack.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch">

   <p>To prepare the drawings for lasercutting I started by splitting the drawing up into components, so I created a new part
     from every part in the final drawing by right clicking on the solid in the tree view and selecting "Make part".</p>

     <img style="width:50%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/MakeParts.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

     <p>For laser cutting I needed to export the faces the I wanted to lasercut as DXF files. I thought this would be much easier
     in Inventor than in Fusion 360 as in Inventor you can right click on any face and select "export face as..." and export as a DXF file.
     This however was not the case as once I had all the DXF files that I needed Inkscape would not open them.</p>

     <img style="width:30%; float:left; margin-left: 20%" src="Myndir/Pressfit/ExportAsDXF.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch">
     <img style="width:30%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/InkscapeDxfError.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch">

     <p style="clear:both;">
     I tried everything I could think of from changing the DXF file output settings to different versions of DXF files to importing the drawings into Autocad and exporting from there,
     I finally got a DXF file into Inkscape after importing the DXF into Fusion 360, then exporting it from there (ironic I know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) but then I
     encountered another problem, I had used a spline to model the curve on the main support which is a curve of degree 5 but Inkscape can only read
     curves of degree 3 or less <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/fusion-360/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Exported-DXF-with-splines-from-Fusion-360-has-issues-opening-in-other-programs.html">(source).</a>
     The solution was to import the file into Autocad and use the "Edit spline" command and convert the spline into a polyline with a precision of 10.
     While searching for the solution for that problem I also found a solution to export DXF files from inventor that Inkscape could read. I first created
     a drawing view of the part and made sure to have the scale at 1:1</p>

     <img style="width:30%; float:left; margin-left: 17%; margin-bottom: 1%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/EditSpline.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch">
     <img style="width:30%; margin-left: 5%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/DrawingSettings.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch">

     <p style="clear:both;">I then saved a copy of the drawing as a dxf, making sure to open the save options and check the box that says "export model geometry only" is checked so that the border of the
     technical drawing does not export with the part.</p>

     <img style="width:40%; float:left; margin-left: 10%" src="Myndir/Pressfit/SaveCopyAs.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch">
     <img style="width:35%; margin-left: 5%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/ModelGeometryOnly.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch">

     <p>Now I could import my DXF files into Inkscape. Once they were in Inkscape I needed to fix the drawings as when the files are imported there is often a translation error
     and the DXF file is not a continuous closed curve even though it seems that way. To fix this I used the same method as in the following video provided by Hafliði,
     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN0jkUGdObw">DXF Segmented Line Fix in Inkscape 2</a>.</p>

     <img style="width:20%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/DXFVandamal.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

     <p>Once all the files had been fixed I ordered them into 600x300mm boxes as that is the maximum size of the laser cutting machine, unfortunately the feet of the laptop stand are
     320x330mm so they will need to be cut in the bigger laser cutting machine which has a workable area of 1010x710mm </p>

     <img style="width:30%; float:left; margin-left: 17%" src="Myndir/Pressfit/InkscapeLitli.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch">
     <img style="width:30%; margin-left: 5%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/InkscapeStori.JPG" alt="Photo of sketch">

     <p>I also added some text onto the top plate, the laser cutting machine automatically determines wether it is supposed to cut or engrave based on the line
     thickness, for 600 dpi settings which we are using the machine cuts all lines that are smaller than 0.125mm but engraves lines that are
     thicker than that, so by adding the text the machine automatically knows to engrave that part of the drawing.
     <br>
     Now it was time to go to FabLab and cut out the parts. To start with I made sure that the height of the laser was correct, as if the laser is to high or
     to low the laser will not cut as cleanly, to make sure the height is correct we use a metal piece that is supposed to barley touch the material.
   </p>

   <img style="width:30%; float:left; margin-left: 17%" src="Myndir/Pressfit/FabLabLaser/HaedEkkiStillt.jpg" alt="Photo of sketch">
   <img style="width:30%; margin-left: 5%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/FabLabLaser/HaedStillt.jpg" alt="Photo of sketch">

   <p>After correcting the height I set the home point to the top left corner of the material and the went to the computer and opened the pdf file that I wanted to cut,
   to send the file to the printer you press print like you would with a normal printer, make sure that the laser cutter is selected, and click properties, then you can
   change the lasercutting settings.
  </p>

  <img style="width:50%;" src="Myndir/Pressfit/FabLabLaser/LaserStillingar.jpg" alt="Photo of sketch" class="center">

<p>The material that I am working with is 4mm wood and the settings for this material in this printer is:
  <ul>
    <li>Rastor settings
      <ul>
        <li>Speed: 60%</li>
        <li>Power: 100%</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Vector settings
      <ul>
        <li>Speed: 5%</li>
        <li>Power: 100%</li>
        <li>Freq: 10</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
I also made sure to change the material size to the size of the material I was working with, 1000x700mm, and that the laser was using 600dpi.
<br>
Now I printed the file, that send it to the printer, to make sure that the correct file was about to be cut I checked the screen of the laser cutter and made sure
that my file was the job to be cut.
